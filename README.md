# TriDimensional – AI-Based 3D Face Reconstruction

TriDimensional is an AI-powered application that reconstructs **realistic 3D face models** from just a **single 2D image** using deep learning techniques. It aims to **simplify complex 3D modeling**, making it more **accessible, faster, and impactful** — especially in areas like **healthcare, AR/VR, gaming, and digital art**.

##  Overview

This project combines cutting-edge models like **3DDFA_V3**, **StarGAN**, **CartoonGAN**, and **DECA** to:
- Reconstruct detailed 3D face meshes from a single 2D image.
- Apply filters like cartoonization, facial aging, and style transfer.
- Support real-time camera inputs via OpenCV.
- Visualize results in an interactive web-based interface.
- Aid **medical evaluation**, especially in assessing **acid attack survivors** or surgical outcomes.
